   <div class="Question roundCorners">
	  <p id="p1">
		 Question 1: Which ball will go faster when dropped?
	  </p>
	<img src="BlueBall.png" alt="Blue Ball With a smaller slope." class="roundCorners">
	<img src="RedBall.png" alt="Red Ball With a larger slope." class="roundCorners">
	<br>
	<input type="button" id="Q1Y" class="button roundCorners" value="Red" >
	<input type="button" id="Q1N" class="button roundCorners" value="Blue" >
   </div>
   <div class="QFail roundCorners" id="Q1F">
	  <p id="p1">
		 Incorrect: The Red Ball is higher up and the ramp is at a steeper slope.
	  </p>
   </div>
   <div class="Question roundCorners" id="Q2">
	  <p id="p1">
		 Question 2: If an object is high up does it have kinetic energy or potential energy?
	  </p>
	<input type="button" id="Q2Y" class="button roundCorners" value="Potential" >
	<input type="button" id="Q2N" class="button roundCorners" value="Kinetic" >
   </div>
   <div class="QFail roundCorners" id="Q2F">
	  <p id="p1">
		 Incorrect: An object that is high up carries potential energy as it has the 'Potential' to transform that energy into kinetic energy, like if it were to fall.
	  </p>
   </div>
   <div class="Question roundCorners" id="Q3">
	  <p id="p1">
		 Question 3: Which line applies to this data?
	  </p>

	<br>
	<input type="button" id="Q3N" class="button roundCorners" value="Quantitative" >
	<input type="button" id="Q3Y" class="button roundCorners" value="Proportional" >
	<input type="button" id="Q3N1" class="button roundCorners" value="Horizontal" >
   </div>
    <div class="QFail roundCorners" id="Q3F">
	  <p id="p1">
		 Incorrect: A graph that has a perfectly strait slope in the form of a strait line is proportional.
	  </p>
   </div>
   <div class="Question roundCorners" id="Q4">
	  <p id="p1">
		 Question 4: True or false: When an object is moving it is transforming potential energy into kinetic energy.
	  </p>
	<input type="button" id="Q4Y" class="button roundCorners" value="True" >
	<input type="button" id="Q4N" class="button roundCorners" value="False" >
   </div>
    <div class="QFail roundCorners" id="Q4F">
	  <p id="p1">
		 Incorrect: An object that is in motion transformes its potential energy into kinetic energy, like if a ball was rolling down a slope, the closer to the ground the ball gets the less potentail energy it has due to gravity.
	  </p>
   </div>
   <div class="Question roundCorners" id="Q5">
	  <p id="p1">
		 Question 5: What confidence is this equation?
	  </p>
	<img src="ConfedenceGraph.png" alt="" class="roundCorners">
	<br>
	<input type="button" id="Q5Y" class="button roundCorners" value="True" >
	<input type="button" id="Q5N" class="button roundCorners" value="False" >
   </div>
    <div class="QFail roundCorners" id="Q5F">
	  <p id="p1">
		 Incorrect: To gauge the confedence you should have in an equation look at how far the predicted point is from the sample data and how many data points the line of best fit runs through.
